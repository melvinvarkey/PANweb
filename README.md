# PANweb
Inspired in my previous script (wich is inspired in the web checkpoint tool) screepa.pl that parses the netscreen firewall config https://github.com/zepryspet/screpa
This new script was created using python (learned in the hard way)
Steps to see the configuration in the webpage:
1. Keep up to date, download  and install python 3+ https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download the configuration file from the palo alto firewall and save it as config.xml
3. Download the python script PANweb.py into the same folder as the configuration file
4. Execute the pytho script (double click on windows)
5. The file should be opened automatically, if not search for a file name configuration.html in the same folder you can open it with your favorite browser (please don't use IE) or with excel

Notes:
-The final file uses dragtable to move the columns https://github.com/akottr/dragtable, if you don't have internet access to download the repository that won't be possible.
